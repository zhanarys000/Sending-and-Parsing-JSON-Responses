Simple Go HTTP Server with JSON Handling
This is a basic Go program that sets up a simple HTTP server to handle POST requests with JSON payloads. The server expects a JSON object with a "message" field in the request body and responds with a success message if the JSON is valid.

Getting Started
Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from https://golang.org/dl/.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Run the Go program:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the server on port 8080.

Usage
Send a POST request to http://localhost:8080/ with a JSON payload in the following format:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Your message here"
}
Example using cURL:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -d '{"message": "Hello, server!"}' http://localhost:8080/
Response
If the server successfully receives and processes the JSON payload, it will respond with a JSON object:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data successfully received"
}
If there are any errors (e.g., invalid JSON format or an empty "message" field), appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes will be returned.
